1. Create a repository: Use the GitHub web interface to create a new repository.

2. Clone the repository: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store your local copy of the repository. Run the command:

git clone <repository_url>


3. Create a branch: Create a new branch in your local repository using the command:

git branch <branch_name>


4. Switch to the branch: Switch to the newly created branch using the command:

git checkout <branch_name>


5. Make changes and commit: Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Once you've made a logical chunk of changes, stage them using the command:

git add .

Commit the changes with a descriptive message using the command:

git commit -m "Your commit message"


6. Push the branch: Push your local branch to the remote repository on GitHub using the command:

git push origin <branch_name>


7. Create a pull request: On the GitHub web interface, navigate to your repository and create a new pull request. Select your branch as the source and the main branch as thetarget.

8. Review and address feedback: Collaborators can review your pull request and provide comments. Make any necessary changes locally and commit them.

9. Merge the pull request: Once the pull request is approved, you can merge it into the main branch using the GitHub web interface.

10. Pull the latest changes: Switch back to the main branch locally using the command:

git checkout main

Pull the latest changes from the main branch into your local branch using the command:

git pull origin main


11. Repeat: Create new branches for future features or bug fixes and follow the same process.

Remember to regularly fetch and pull the latest changes from the remote repository to stay updated with the work of other team members.
